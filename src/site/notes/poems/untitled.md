My life is not a curation  
of well defined breaks  
and picture perfect moments  
It is an entanglement of   
half cooked ideas,  
and unwritten words  
long lost memories and  
childhood unlearnt.  
It is the colloquial   
chest hair that the mosquito   
can’t escape, a web of  
emotions and rationality   
at play.  
  
Somedays are raw unedited B roll  
a cat purring on a sunny balcony  
Others like a formula one race  
hours blending into millisecond cachophony.  

And there are the ones in between  
where I struggle and fall  
harder to categorise  
would fool a machine.  

I’ve long held it as a weakness  
to be broken and show it  
to be human and mistake it  
Because process is for books  
and as products we must pretend  
to have no exceptions or flaws  
cos if we accepted our blindspots  
wouldn’t that be a shame.  

We’re all grainy pictures in a time of super resolution  
blind enough to see everything  
for what it’s not  
and hide behind our own fallacies
