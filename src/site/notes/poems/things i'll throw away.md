One day I'll throw away  
Your care wrapped around an anklet  
Your songs stuck on my phone  
Click click click  

I'll throw away the picture of your body   
Burned in my head / your presence in my room  
The smell I caught behind your ear  
In the middle of a dream  

One day I'll free myself of  
Parts of you in me,  
And parts of me that ask  
Of your well being  

One day I'll be old, and laugh,  
Reminiscing, fondly,  
Of things I did and  
Didn't do for you  

One day I'll be able to explain  
Why I'm still thinking of you  
When you'll clearly never  
Here, be.
