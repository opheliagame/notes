I met a boy once  
on a screen, in a beautiful paragraph  
He said he only wrote fiction  
with a hint of his past.  
that he didnâ€™t care about rhythm  
or the stuff between the lines  

Knowing him was reading a book  
he had written anonymously  
The kind to re read once every few months  
to find something new  

Naturally, I told him the story  
I never admitted to have  
He listened with his eyes  
never shifting his glance.  

He has seen the parts of me  
I am ashamed to hide  
never once flinching from their   
ugly sight.  

I met a boy once  
in a dream, in morning daylight  
he was writing, I was reading  
a play with strange characters  
but one.
