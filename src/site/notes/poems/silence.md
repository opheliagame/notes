She is the bedsheet I wrap around myself in the morning  
The only voice being the one in my head  
I like to breathe in before I breathe out  
Just be with her before anything else.  

We were first introduced in class  
"Hey, I'm the pin drop", she said  
I disliked by proxy  
She, who was summoned by the teacher herself.  

Our relationship has grown since  
An increase in understanding reciprocated with peace offerings  
Alone time with her was once like punishment  
Now it feels like self care.   
  
I'm sure you've seen her too  
Unsure of herself inside a court  
Begrudgingly in the parliament  
Or maybe uninvited in your own house.  
  
But don't mistake her for being docile like I did  
She has wrapped herself around my neck enough times for me to take note  
Challenging me to muster my sorry words  
Scratching my throat.  
  
Given that is how it is,  
You say, why would I not wish for her to be gone  
Valid question it would be, if not everyone had their flaws  
More importantly, I'd never want to wake up to the other one.
