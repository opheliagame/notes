But before that; why do I have a website? 
For one, I am not someone who has a lot of thoughts worth publicly writing about. And while I certainly enjoy documenting things[^1], more often than not, I struggle with words. 

This website began, like a lot of things do with me, as a way of measuring progress; specifically, trying to learn how to write fragment shaders by making tiny shaders and then explaining the process as best I could by writing a small article[^2]. Sadly though, I never got quite far with that series, and after [[writings/chess board\|chess board]], [[writings/texture land\|texture land]], and [[writings/mondrian\|mondrian]], I continued to write more shaders but never got around to writing another article. 

Then sometime in January 2022, [I decided to redesign my website every year on twitter](https://twitter.com/anushkatr/status/1481567649192906752) and the current version is a continuation of this exercise with some major structural redesigns and less important visual ones[^3].  It started with wanting a better workflow for writing to help me think better, and the idea of building a digital garden [^4][^5] really stuck with me. I am giving myself the space to not agonise over every single word and how it may sound to an external audience, and instead use writing as a way to consolidate floaty bits of thoughts that I sometimes happen to have. 

Let me then make an incomplete list of things this garden might have 
- notes about current projects 
- half cooked slash uncooked ideas for new projects 
- rationalizing slash historical bits, like this one, about why I do certain things 
- unasked for opinions 
- jokes in footnotes 
- more jokes than references in footnotes
- more incomplete lists
- lists saying "lists are fun but totally pointless"
- [[on art made with software\|on art made with software]] poems 

update - 30/05/2023
I have not been writing a lot or taking notes. This website is almost turning out to be just like the previous ones where I engage with  it only rarely. I want to stop that and write more often even if it doesn't make sense. I want to tend to this garden. So I will try to make a habit to do this whenever I am consuming some media and integrate them into the garden at the end of the day or whenever feels right for a few seconds.
