Conjugate variables have complementarity, which means that they cannot be measured at the same time. 
For example, frequency and time are conjugate. To measure frequency more accurately you need to spend more time. 

It is only possible to certainly measure one of either position or momentum of a particle. 

This is not due to a limitation of measuring devices.

When the position is known accurately, the momentum becomes uncertain and vice versa.

Uncertainty principle is explained by the mathematical fact that the wave function of momentum is the [[quantum30/Fourier transform\|Fourier transform]] of the wave function of position. 

One possible explanation as to why this happens in below 
	to know position of something you have to shine light on it
	at quantum scales, light is made of photons which have energy and momentum

There are two scenarios 
	smaller wavelength light will have high energy photons
	can get a good image $\Delta x$ is low but since the photon is high energy it moves the particle and $\Delta p$ becomes high
	higher wavelength light will have low energy photons
	will get a blurry image $\Delta x$ is high but since the photon is low energy it doesn't move the particle and $\Delta p$ becomes low
