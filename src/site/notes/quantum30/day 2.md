I started to read [Quantum Country](https://quantum.country/) today. I think it is a much better resource for me compared to watching videos. It is also quite an interesting approach to learning so I am looking forward to progressing with it. 


Things noted from today's videos 
- [[Deterministic world\|Deterministic world]] vs [[Probabilistic world\|Probabilistic world]]
- Measurement collapses the wave function
	- It is not actually known how this happens 
- Superposition and the double slip experiment 
- [[quantum30/Quantum Entanglement\|Quantum Entanglement]]
- [[quantum30/Quantum tunnelling\|Quantum tunnelling]]
- [[quantum30/Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle\|Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] 
- [[quantum30/computers are a fundamental feature of the universe\|computers are a fundamental feature of the universe]] 
- [[quantum30/qubit\|qubit]]
