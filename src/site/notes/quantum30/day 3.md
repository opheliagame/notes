I was planning to make some progress with Quantum Country today as well but then I got hit with some biology happening in my uterus so could not proceed. But here are a few observations from today

- [[quantum30/Quantum Field Theory\|Quantum Field Theory]] 
- There are 3 fundamental particles ( well 12 actually )

| lightest |  | heaviest |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **electron** | muon | tau |
| [[quantum30/neutrino\|neutrino]] | muon quark | tau quark |
| **up quark** | strange quark | bottom quark |
| **down quark** | charm quark | up quark |

| forces | fields |
| ---- | ----- |
| gravity | space time |
| electro magnetic | electro magnetic |
| strong force (holds together nucleus) | gluon field |
| weak force (radioactive decay) | w z bozon field | 
| higgs particle | higgs field (responsible for mass) |

- proton is 2 up quarks and 1 down quark
- neutron is 2 down quarks and 1 up quark 
- Vacuum is made of fields - Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations 
- Ideas of unification 
	- Grand Unified Theory
	- Super symmetry
	- String theory
