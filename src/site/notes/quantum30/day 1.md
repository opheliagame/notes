Today will be the first day of this one month long learning challenge. 
Initially I had thought of using substack for publishing my daily learning notes, but obsidian seems like a much better idea for further refinement and continued learning. 

A list of interesting points  
- Humans are a mathematical anomaly[^1]
	- do we romanticise being made of stardust? short answer, yes.
- singularity is a tricky concept. highly possible for it not to exist.
- there is a smallest unit of time. one Planck time. 
- grand unified force is a khichdi of electromagnetic, gravitation, weak and strong force. 
	- what is the naming convention being weak and strong forces?
- Information cannot travel faster than light but space can.
	- [[causality\|causality]]
- where does mass come from 
	- Higgs Field being massless vs gaining non zero potential 
- There are more particles than anti particles
	- this is a huge reason for why the universe is the way it is
- [[quantum30/Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\|Big Bang Nucleosynthesis]]
- [[quantum30/Cosmic Microwave Background\|Cosmic Microwave Background]]
- Quantum mechanics predicts all the elements in the periodic table[^2]
