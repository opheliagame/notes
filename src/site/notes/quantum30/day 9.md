Today's videos were quite low on information. And since I am already continuing with Quantum Country, a lot of the information that was delivered, I already knew. 

There were two key takeaways though which I will list here and then pull into other notes at some later point in time

- As the size of transistors gets smaller, there is a chance for them to stop working in the intended manner since electrons start exhibiting the phenomenon of [[quantum30/Quantum tunnelling\|Quantum tunnelling]]. This is a key reason why people began thinking of building Quantum computers (?)
- Quantum computers are not a replacement for classical computers. 
	- Every operation on a quantum computer is not faster. 
	- Certain kinds of problems are easier to solve with quantum computers since it takes an exponentially smaller number of steps to solve compared to classical computers.
