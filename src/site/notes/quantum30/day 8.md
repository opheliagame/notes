I am finding that the end of first week and the beginning of second week has not been as enthusiastic for me as it was initially. To some extent, I am failing to connect with the material as much and the fact that all of it is in video format does not help. There seems to be this illusion of understanding something but I feel like I actually don't, and if someone were to dig deeper they would realise that the foundation for all this new information doesn't exist. 

Anyway, I think that is why this has taken me quite some time to get back to, but get back we shall.
