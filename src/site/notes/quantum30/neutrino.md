A fundamental particle that does not interact with other types of matter. 

It is a really good option for making quantum wire (see [[quantum30/Quantum Circuits\|Quantum Circuits]]) but because of the same property, it becomes really difficult to design [[quantum30/Quantum Logic Gates\|Quantum Logic Gates]] for it which can manipulate its' state in a controlled manner.
