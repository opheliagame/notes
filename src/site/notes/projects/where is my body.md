> Ghias, we must be careful not to teach the girls too much. How will they ever find husbands if they are too learned? The less they know, the less they will want of the outside world.

> When is abortion legal? If continuing the pregnancy involves a risk to the mother's life. Continuing pregnancy would cause grave damage to the physical or mental health of the mother. The pregnancy has been caused by rape. If the child is born, it would be gravely deformed. Any method of family planning adopted by the couple has failed.

> Every woman knows that, regardless of all her other achievements, she is a failure if she is not beautiful.

i like to collect sentences. it is one of the best things about owning a kindle; you can highlight! i do have a wip project ([[my readwise\|my readwise]]) to be able to go back to these kindle highlights. 

the randomness of these collections of sentences is fascinating. because it is not quite random but the associations can be wild and new ones form each time you go through it again. i'm sure that i will not highlight the same things when reading something for the second time.  

it was with this fascination that i started working on wimb. i don't quite recall why i chose the body as a site to start this collection, this archive of thoughts. but the process has been very interesting. i have read a lot, i have marked a lot, i have thought about my body a lot. 

during a short flirtation with blender, i remember thinking about making a building with rooms that represent parts of my body. (*maybe i can find the handwritten notes somewhere*) and the digital part of the project developed for serendipity is a combination of the same ideas. you see a bunch of doors and entering them presents you with a series of choices where you pick sentences from the archive, creating your own personal archive of choices. to be honest, both these archives are not rigorous at all. they are temporary sites of data collection with the latter not existing anywhere outside of your memory and experience. they are casual. they are destroyed and are built again. but just like going through your highlights brings back something, these sentences act as inviting hooks into the original material; material that speaks through many voices about the same subject that is the human body. 

for the physical leg of the project i experimented with an arduino and raspberry pi setup for the first time (physical computing is fun but oh so anxiety inducing). i wanted for people to be able to engage with the archive in a more immediate manner and landed on the idea of a typewriter as a mouthpiece for the archive.
